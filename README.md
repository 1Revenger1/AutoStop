# AutoStop
Restarts Spigot Minecraft server at a set time and gives reminders. There's probably better plugins out there that do this, but I didn't feel like downloading one of those.

## Using
Drop the compiled jar into the plugins folder on the Spigot server, then run the server. The plugin will not be enabled, requiring the owner to edit the config file for the plugin. Set "Enabled" to true, as well as the messages and times (in seconds). The times for serverShutDown is from the time the server starts up. The warning times are seconds until the server shuts down (ie 5 seconds would leave a message 5 seconds before the server shuts down)
